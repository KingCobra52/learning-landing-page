//General structure of landing page 

// Hero: Clear value proposition / what the product is + who it's for 
//CampusCabs is a Penn State rideshare app that offers cheaper rides by letting drivers keep a larger share of every fare.


// Problem (short): Why rides are too expensive.
//Uber charges drivers a percentage per ride.
//Drivers lose up to 30%-40% of every fare.
//Inflated prices to cover driver costs.
//Riders pay more.


// Solution (short): Why CampusCabs is better for students and drivers.
//We charge drivers a flat subscription to use the app.
//Drivers keep 80-90% of every fare.
//No inflated prices needed.
//Riders pay less.


//CTA (core of page): Rider/Driver toggle + short info form (name, email, phone) + submit.
//Join the waitlist 

// Primary CTA (again at bottom): Same button → scrolls back to the signup form.
